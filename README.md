patco-gtfs
==========

Build [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) files using data extracted from [PATCO's PDF schedule](http://www.ridepatco.org/schedules/schedules.asp).

Note that PATCO has started publishing [official GTFS](http://www.ridepatco.org/developers/).

The official GTFS differs from the one produced by this project. I intend to continue maintaining this project for awhile yet.

The results of the process have been uploaded in the past to the GTFS Data Exchange:
<http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/patco/>

I'm not going to post my unofficial GTFS there any longer, as there is now an official source.

Build status:
=============
[![](https://travis-ci.org/flibbertigibbet/patco-gtfs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flibbertigibbet/patco-gtfs)

To use:
=======
1.  Extract data from each table in the schedule PDF into the corresponding direction\_weekday.csv file.

    [Tabula](https://github.com/jazzido/tabula) helps with this, but the result may need some fixing.

2.  Edit bike ban times by modifying bike\_ban\_times.csv.  If the file is missing or has only the header row,
    bikes will be allowed at all times.  Fields are:  
    *  `direction_id` -> 0 for trips to Lindenwold, 1 for trips into Philadelphia
    *  `service_id` -> integer from calendar.txt indicating which days of the week
    *  `start_time` -> time of day when ban starts, in 24-hour format for hours and minutes (HH:MM)
    *  `end_time` -> time of day when ban ends, in 24-hour format for hours and minutes (HH:MM)
    
3.  Write the new trips.txt and stop\_times.txt by running make\_trips\_stops.py:  
        `python make_trips_stops.py`

4.  Modify calendar.txt in the gtfs\_files directory to set the schedule's effective date.

5.  Run make\_calendar\_dates.py, first modifying use\_holidays.txt if the holidays in range have changed.
    Be sure to update calendar.txt first, as holidays will be scheduled within the effective date range.  
        `python make_calendar_dates.py`
        
6.  If the fare prices need updating, modify the fare\_attributes.txt file directly in the gtfs\_files directory.

7.  Zip the contents of the gtfs\_files directory, and validate the results with [Google's GTFS validator](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator).
